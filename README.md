# FPGA_LAB_4

Project Description: In this project we are creating a Vehicle Lock and Warning System by using our knowledge in combinational logic. We are given a number of inputs and outputs and it is up to you to understand how these inputs and outputs interact with eachother and finally program it on your FPGA board. 

Instructions:
1) Develop your code and testbenchb using Dataflow implementation and simulate to see your results
2) Edit your constraints file to map the inputs and outputs on the pins
3) Then succesfully synthesize and implement your file
4) Generate bitstream and program the device
5) Finally test your FPGA board with a number of inputs to see outputs especially for Start_Engine, your 2 Warnings, and Chime.
